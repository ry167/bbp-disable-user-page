Disable the user profile page for bbPress.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that disables all user profile pages for bbPress. They will instead return 404 errors.

This helps prevent any negative consequences of spammers and bots registering on your site and creating a profile page.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file from GitHub: https://github.com/ryanhalliday/bbp-disable-user-page/archive/master.zip
2. Upload it to your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Why isn't this on the WordPress plugin repository?

This is a very simple plugin I hope to never update. It's not worth the upload process and dealing with SVN etc.
